# maicab_fullsize
A collection of notes and lessons learned from building a maimai-like home arcade cabinet. 
This is not meant as a "guide" as its unlikely your build will be the same as mine. Instead, hopefully the lessons learned here can help you in your own similar project. 

Special thanks to these guides and the help they offered:

## Finished Project:

Here is a look at the finished project running Majdata Play. (Majdata Play is an open-source software that allows you to play custom charts for maimai.) https://github.com/LingFeng-bbben/MajdataPlay

This is a somewhat controversial choice.  Brand new options are far too expensive. I was able to find it on offer for around $500. You might be able to find a similar option.

Most guides suggest a touch screen display is not suitable for high level play. So far this option has been totally sufficient for around level 10-11 play. it might be that on higher levels of play that its not good enough. I'm not there yet so I cant say. I will say the touch responsiveness and latency so far have been great. Perfect timing taps are super easy. It supports 10 point touch. I do suspect that "circular slides" on the touch screen may not be possible. 

One last note that made this display a working option compared to other touch displays, is that only skin touch is registering as a touch. The front faceplate of my build sits directly above the screen with a small foam cushion between the board and display. This foam cushion does not register a touch and doesnt interfere with the touch screen.
