This is a somewhat controversial choice. 

Latency/Accuracy; Most guides suggest a touch screen display is not suitable for high level play. So far this option has been totally sufficient for around level 10-11 play (I havent attempted higher yet..). it might be that on higher levels of play that its not good enough. I'm not there yet so I cant say. I will say the touch responsiveness and latency so far have been great. Perfect timing taps are super easy. It supports 10 point touch. I do suspect that "circular slides" on the touch screen may cause some trouble.

Cost; Brand new options are far too expensive. I was able to find it on offer for around $500. You might be able to find a similar option.

One last note that made this display a working option compared to other touch displays, is that only skin touch is registering as a touch. The front faceplate of my build sits directly above the screen with a small foam cushion between the board and display. This foam cushion does not register a touch and doesnt interfere with the touch screen. 


### Buttons (8x):
There is a variety of button options for the project, including 3d printing your own. 

I bought 8 of these from alibaba:

The quality is great and I am happy with it. This was one of the bigger purchases; 8x $12.50  + shipping + tax = $166

### Spacers 
8 x 3d printed spacer (Cost of filament)
I printed at home (ender 3 s1 pro printer) the file from Syndric's github: https://github.com/Syndric/maimai-controller-fullsize/blob/master/cad/Spacer/Maispacer_blank%20v12.stl

### Extra Buttons:
2 x Arcade Buttons (10.88 total)
I used the red and blue button from this set for the "Insert Coin" and "1P Select" button:

### Faceplate
1 x 12mm white birch plywood (90 euro including cuts)

I'm going to refer to the board that is between the buttons and the display as the Faceplate. 
I used a single 12mm white birch plywood. I also had OBI (hardware store) cut out the shape I needed. The cost of the cuts and the materials was about 90 euros.

### NFC Reader:

1 x PN532 : https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Module-Binghe-Pieces-Communication-Compatible/dp/B0D86CPN5J/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1BHPWDPD6GNNP&sprefix=pn532%2Caps%2C339&sr=8-5

I 3d printed a random PN532 enclosure from thingiverse. Sorry I dont know which one anymore.
